   <div class="about-page-paragraph">
           <h4 class="font-weight-bold about-page-title"><span class="headding-first-leater"><first>A</first></span>bout  Islamic Center:</h4>
          <p><strong><first>T</first>he Glorious Qur-an says, “Truth has arrived, and falsehood perished, For falsehood (by its nature) bound to perish”.</strong> (Sura Bani Israil-81)

					 <p><first>W</first>hat is Truth? The Bengali word “Sathya, is derived from the word Sat” which means everlasting, permanent, established, true, proper, correct, accurate and indestructible.  In Arabic Al-Haq stands for the word Truth which is one of the greatest names of <strong>Allah</strong>. We worship The Truth. The opposite of the Truth is falsehood, untrue, inaccurate improper, incorrect, baseless, imaginary, destructible, deceptive and satanic.
          The struggle between the Truth and the falsehood or the fight between Religion and irreligion is eternal and everlasting.</p>

         <p><first>I</first><span>n <strong>the Holy Qur-an, Allah</strong> has presented this struggle between the Truth and the falsehood in the following<strong>:</strong></span></p>


         <p><first><strong>He (Allah)</strong></first> sends down water from the skies, and the channels flow, each according to its measure: but the torrent bears away the foam the mounts up to the surface. Even so from that (ore) which the heat in the fire, to make ornaments or utensils there with, there is scum likewise. Thus does <strong>Allah</strong> ( by parables ) show Truth and falsehood. for the scum disappears like forth cast out; while that which is for the good  of mankind remains on the earth. Thus does <strong>Allah</strong> set forth parables.</p>


         <p><first>Consequently</first> as per the Divine Rule the investigation of the Truth is difficult and risky. Even the cost may be life transportation which is the supreme sacrifice. The greatest champion of preserver of the Truth in this world is Hazrat Imam Hussain (A:) who became martyr in the battle of Karbala.</p>
         <p><span><strong>Qur-an</strong> tells,</span></p>
       <ol type="1">
         <li><strong>Allah</strong> is the Truth Reality; those besides Him, they invoke, they are but vain falsehood; verily <strong>Allah</strong> is He, Most High Most great. (Sura Haj-62)</li>
         <li>The Truth is from thy <strong>Lord</strong>; so be not at all in doubt. (Sura Baqara-147)</li>
         <li>And pursue not that of which thou has no knowledge: For surely the hearing, the sight, the hearth of all those shall be questioned of. (Sura Bani Israil-33)</li>
         <li>O you, who believe! avoid suspicion as much (as possible); for suspicion in some cases is sin. (Sura Huzrat-12)</li>
       </ol>

         <p><first>In</first> pursuance with these instructions of <strong>Allah</strong> it is imperative of all human being to be a Truth seeker. He must exercise and muster his all senses and employ his resources to know and understand the Truth i.e Reality, which is obligatory or in other word Farj. Before come to this earth man is pledged bound to his Lord on this issue. As such if he is reluctant to pursue this responsibility he may be punished.</p>

         <p><first><strong>Allah</strong></first> has instructed and send down the code of conduct and Rules and Regulations for conducting socio-religion-political, economic and cultural guide lines through His Messengers and Divine Books. So that, this Din-Ul-Haq (Divine Guidance) will win over all the theories, ideas, concepts, isms, social values and manners created by so called scientist and philosophers thinkers.</p>
         <p><span><strong>The Holy Qur-an</strong>  says as follows<strong>:</strong></span></p>
       <ul style="list-style-type:square">
         <li>It is He Who has sent His Messenger with guidance and the Religion of Truth, to make it prevail over all Religion, and enough is <strong>Allah</strong> for witness. (Sura Fatha-28)</li>
       </ul>


         <p><span>In the context of administering the world the Role of the Messengers and their successors in <strong>The Holy Qur-an</strong> is mentioned below<strong>:</strong></span></p>
       <ol type="1">
         <li><strong>Allah</strong> did chose Adam and Noah, the family of Abraham and the family Imran above all people: Offspring one of the other; ( Sura Al-Imran-33-34)</li>
         <li>And We bestowed on Him (Ibrahim ) Ishaaque and , as an additional gift ( a grand son), and Yakub and We made righteous men of every one of them. And We made them leaders, guiding (men) by the Our Command, and We inspired them to do good deeds. ( Sura Al-Imran-72-73)</li>
         <li>He said, I will make thee (Ibrahim) an Imam (Ruler/leader) to the people. He pleaded; “ also Imams from my offspring ! He answered, but My promise is not within the reach of evil doers.” ( Sura Baqara-124)</li>
         <li>That is (the bounty) Whereas <strong>Allah</strong> gives glad tidings to His Servants who believe and do righteous deeds, Say, “ No reward do I ask of you for this except the love of those near of kin.” And if anyone earns any good, We shall give him an increase of good in respect thereof: for <strong>Allah</strong> is Oft-Forgiving, Grateful. (Sura Sura-23)</li>
         <li> We said, get down “ all from here; and if, as is sure, there comes to you guidance from Me, whosoever follows my guidance on them, shall be no fear nor shall they grieve. ( Sura Baqara-38).</li>
       </ol>


         <p><first>In</first> accordance with the above Divine Instructions as along as the Creator and the creation also, life and death exits till such time, the activities and functions of the Messengers of <strong>Allah</strong> will continue which is a perpetual succession and inviolable divine Rule. But after the physical disappearances of the Messengers, the task will be continued and pursued by the Warasatul Ambiya ( successor of Prophethood). In this case, the Ahle-Baiyat or the Holy family members of the Prophe Mohammad (SA:).</p>

         <p><first>I</first><span>n this regard Prophet(SA:) said<strong>:</strong></span></p>
         <p>I leave you two invaluable things :- One of them is <strong>The Holy Qur-an</strong> and the another one is My Ahle-Baiyat. Those who would follow them firmly they will never be misguided. “But those who were blind in this world, will be blind in the Hereafter, (Al-Hadith) and most astray from the path (Sura Bani Israil-72.)</p>


         <p><first>The</first> Messengers of <strong>Allah</strong> are the supreme witness of the Truth. It is the misfortune of the mankind that, after the demise of the Holy Prophet (SA:) the Islamic Leadership and socio-economic policies of Islam could not be pursued in the desired level and way. The highly progressive religio-political, economic and secular social justice of Islam could not be established. Rather, ultra tribal so-called aristocracy, tyranny, imperialism, and perverted form of capitalism entered into the religious arena of Islam. Consequently through a counter revolution the eternal values of the religion is lost. Subsequently the reminiscence of the Islamic values were buried by the Omayya & Abbasia rulership. At present, due to the introduction of anti-people policies pursued by the ferocious imperialist and their anti religious socio political and economic theories/isms. the  humanity has fallen into a great crisis. Today the Truth is unavailable and is considered as bitter or absent in political, social, economic and cultural activities of the world.</p>
         <p><span> In view of the above, our motto is <strong>:</strong></span></p>
       <ol type="1">
         <li> As the Children of Hazrat Adam and Eve (Peace be upon them) and trusting in oneness of <strong>Allah</strong>, Mohammed (SA:) as Messenger of <strong>God</strong> and His Ahle-Baiyat, <strong>The Holy Qur-an</strong> and in the sincere belief of the Resurrection Day,  the Muslims, the Hindus, the Jews, the Christians, the Buddist, the Sikhs, the Janis and the Zarathustrian and the believers of all other sects should have the sense of universal brotherhood and harmony and cordiality.</li>
         <li><strong>The Qur-an, The Torah, The Jabur, The Injil (Bible), The Veda, The Geeta, The Sreemat Bhagobhat, The Rik, The Jaju, The Sam, The Atharva, The Tripitak, The Jind-avesta and The Grantha Shaheb </strong> and all other Divine Books and Scriptures should conduct study, translate, research, analysis and their publicity and publication.</li>
         <li>To study, research and analyze  the exiting socio economic and political theories and literature, music and painting  in the perspective of their respective sociological implication and evaluate their roles and utility keeping with the spirit of true human values.</li>
         <li>To organize Seminar, Symposium, discussion meeting on all the Messengers of <strong>Allah</strong> and All  Sufis & Saints and all divine people of all the religions and their lives and teachings to achieve the  true knowledge.</li>
         <li>It is an admitted fact, that there are different openions in different religious believes and social customs, yet any hate, pride, creation of rudeness, and acrimonious, and all kinds of terrorist  attack on each other is irreligious and worst than killing. So in order to avoid such type of activities and behavior there should be exchange of views and ideas among various religions leaders and will try utmost hard to have cordial, sympathetic and true relationship with all the religious communities of the world.</li>
